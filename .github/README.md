This is a Grasshopper plugin containing a collection of utilities.

Melanoplus is a large genus of Grasshopper. From icon design to component and menu placement, it is designed to blend into native Grasshopper and minimize the presence of the plugin.

## Install

- Install using the `_PackageMager` command in Rhino and search for `Melanoplus`

To maximize compatibility, only .NET Framework version is published on PackageManager; while .NET version is offered in the release section.

> Version x.1.x targets .NET 7.0, and only works with Rhino 8 when `_SetDotNetRuntime` is in `/netcore` mode (default).<br>
> Version x.0.x targets .NET Framework 4.8, and works with Rhino 7.19+ and Rhino 8.

*Ie: 0.1.6 and 0.0.6 is the same version of the plugin*

[Read more](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinocommon/moving-to-dotnet-7/) on .NET and .NET Framework differences.

> Melanoplus is tested against the latest version of Rhino at the time of release. <br>
> While Melanoplus is designed and tested on Windows, Mac users can still install this plugin at their own discretion.
