Melanoplus is a large genus of Grasshopper

This Grasshopper plugin comprises a set of utilities designed to enhance the native Grasshopper experience by introducing essential functions that are currently absent.

## Install

- Install using the `_PackageMager` command in Rhino and search for `Melanoplus`

For compatibility optimization, only the .NET Framework version is published on PackageManager, while the .NET version is provided in the release section.

The minor version denotes the targeted framework:
- Version x.1.x is tailored for .NET 7.0, functioning exclusively with Rhino 8 when `_SetDotNetRuntime` is in `/netcore` mode, the default setting in Rhino 8.
- Version x.0.x is geared towards .NET Framework 4.8, compatible with Rhino 7.19+ and Rhino 8.

For instance, 1.1.6 and 1.0.6 represent the same version of the plugin.

>Melanoplus is tested against the most recent version of Rhino available at the time of its release. While Melanoplus is primarily designed and validated for Windows, Mac users can still choose to install this plugin at their own discretion.
